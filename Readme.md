## Note

These APIs are developed for [Presta](https://github.com/und3fined/presta), of course I want to make this as agnostic as possible but there will be some utilities for developers like [Dynamic Widget For Flutter](https://github.com/und3fined/dynamic-widget-for-flutter) that for someone else are useless.
